## GPRC - 


### GRPC Basics -

* server-side stub generated by gRPC is always asynchronous impl. thats why method has no returned value.
  * hence we use `StreamObserver` callback interface to send data back. that's why we use `onCompleted` to indicate server has finished sending response.  
  * to execute from command line `mvn -DskipTests package exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.github.mcoder.SampleGrpcApplication` can be used.
  * it is upto client weather to block the call , for blocking we have blocking stub and async or future stub for non blocking call
